[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/irdyansages/For_Power/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/irdyansages/For_Power/-/commits/master) [![Latest Release](https://gitlab.com/irdyansages/For_Power/-/badges/release.svg)](https://gitlab.com/irdyansages/For_Power/-/releases) 

User-made campaign for Battle for Wesnoth. Development started at 20 May of 2012. First version released at 29 October of 2012.

It is a multi part campaign. All chapters share the protagonist and some important characters. This is the tale of a young mage Clare and her path to power. It starts in the Northlands during The Age of Fear. Most of its scenarios take place in the Northlands but you will also get to visit Wesnoth and lands to east from it.

A short time ago, Clare completed her studies at the Great Academy and returned to her village. After some time of peace she must face orcs' assaults. She starts only with her childhood friend Lemyr and some fellow villagers but throughout the campaign, various kind of folks will join her (both regular recruits and heroes). Over time, all heroes become more powerful and they will even have a lot of advancements. Though some of them will have to pay for it. After completing each chapter, your army is stored and is available in the next one but at certain points you lose some its parts (as the campaign lasts much longer than hundred years).

Chapters one to five are completed but may be unbalanced, half of planned scenarios from Chapter 6 are also present. This add-on is available on 1.18 server.
There are also a few multiplayer scenarios/campaigns somehow related to the campaign here.
