A new version is out. Its highlight is achievements for accomplishing various feats through the campaigns. There are only a few of them for now but more might be added in future versions. Another notable change is in rune teleports in scenario Damsel in Distress - they are now regular teleports. That means moving on them does not automatically teleport the unit to the other end, they have to use another movement point to walk through but on the other hand you can see where the unit can move (e. g. when the unit is selected or highlited).
