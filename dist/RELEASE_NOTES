A new version is out. There are no big changes or new scenarios, just some quality of life improvements and internal improvements. The most important change is that highwaymen can advance into a 4 unit in Chapter 6 now, Morcyn even has some experiences when starting the chapter from scratch. All scenarios in Chapter 6 now have time over dialogue and death speeches for allies. Non-standard leadeship abilites (those that do not depend on unit's level) for Lemyr and Jolla have the relevant level in their name, their implementation was also changed which might cause issues with save files from previous versions.
