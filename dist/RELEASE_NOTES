A new version is out. It does not bring any new exciting features, just some improvements. Probably the biggest one is a new introduction of Chapter 1 - it now describes better Clare's background. There is now a warning at start of Chapter 3 that units from Chapter 1 will be lost at the end of the chapter. I also increased some stats for Lemyr as High Paladin (it is used in the multiplayer campaign) as mainline's Paladin's stats were improved for Wesnoth 1.18. Another change is in icon for hard difficulty level for Chapters 2, 3 and 4 (I changed it from Arch Mage to Silver Mage).
