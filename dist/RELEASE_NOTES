A new version is out. It finally brings new scenarios - there are 2 new non talk-only ones in Chapter 6. But besides that, there are changes in existing content. The biggest one is heroes' amlas - even though they appear almost the same as before, they are organized differently so save files from previous versions will not work correctly. The four riders killing orcs in scenario Repelling the Orcs were changed to horsemen - it makes sense for them to do a charge attack (as opposed to cavalrymen). Killing too many enemies in a scenario is explicitly stated as a defeat condtion in Chapter 6. On Wesnoth 1.19 Clare's shadow wave's damage is she were chaotic and Lemyr's lightbeam's damage is as if he were lawful. Amiwen's attack gossamer was renamed to ethereal web on Wesnoth 1.19 (to reflect change in mainline). Description (and introduction) of Chapter 2 was tweaked to accomodate both paths in Chapter 1 and to reflect terminology for the final boss in good path of Chapter 1. The cutscene in Chapter 1 where Clare rejects Haldar was rewritten - Haldar now has a reaction and gives a hint why he wanted to teach Clare.
