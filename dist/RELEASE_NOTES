A new version is out. The biggest change is heroes' amlas - even though they appear almost the same as before, they are organized differently so save files from previous versions will not work correctly. The four riders killing orcs in scenario Repelling the Orcs were changed to horsemen - it makes sense for them to do a charge attack (as opposed to cavalrymen). Killing too many enemies in a scenario is explicitly stated as a defeat condtion in Chapter 6.
